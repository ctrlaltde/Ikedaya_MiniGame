# Ikedaya_MiniGame
Create with Code Course - Personal Project

This is a personal project to test the knowledge from the Create with Code Course offered on Unity. 
The game is a very basic representation of the historic event taking place in Kyoto, Japa - called the Ikedaya Incident (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikedaya_incident). 
The final game should have a playable Shinsengumi character which will slash a pre-determined # of enemies until a boss appears and the game will end. Very simple, very basic.
